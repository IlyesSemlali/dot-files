# "." is long enough for a title

## Goal

### The worst config to lose focus

This setup is made to never lose focus, never be distracted and to be able to have all the tools needed to work efficiently. This is important.

This setup is made to never lose focus, never be distracted and to be able to have all the tools needed to have fun efficiently. Yes this too is important.

### Multitasking is not that hard

A typical day is never made one hundred percent of code. Sometimes you work, sometimes you chill. This is made easy.

### Health and lazyness

Configuring each tool to work at it's best with only a few keystrokes is a lifelong search. This is the start of that work.

## Appearance

Looks can be distracting. Ugly things that pop up somewhere on the screen can be annoying. Nothing here is beautiful, the goal here is to have a consistent look everywhere. Nothing too ugly, nothing to distracting.

### Themes

The Arc theme is used, it's using the murrine gtk engine which has to be installed.

```
emerge x11-themes/arc-theme
```

### Fonts

(TODO: the following line is not actually true for now)
All fonts used in GTK and QT apps are included in this repo.

The same goes for the ones used in Alacritty and Xmonad (xmobar)

## Installation

TODO
